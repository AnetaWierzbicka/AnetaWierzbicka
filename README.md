## Hi!👋  Explore my world of testing! 🚀

🎓 I graduated from the Warsaw School of Economics with a major in E-business, specializing in E-business Management.<br> As an **analytical thinker**,  I enjoy exploring new challenges and solving problems. 

💻 My journey in software testing started with the **Testing Academy** and the **ISTQB certification**. <br>I’ve also participated in **crowdtesting projects**. I gained experience in **exploratory testing**, **writing test cases**, and **reporting bugs**.<br> Additionally, I have a solid foundation in **SQ**L and **API testing**.

🛠️ **Tools I use:** Jira, TestRail, Postman, Git, Chrome DevTools, and more.
